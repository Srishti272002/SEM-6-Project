Image Steganography

This is a technique of hiding secret information within an image without changing its visual appearance.In image steganography, the secret message is hidden within the pixel values of an image by modifying their color values or spatial positions. The modified image looks visually similar to the original image, and only the intended recipient with the knowledge of the secret key or password can extract the hidden message.
